/**
 * The textures the buffer passes render into.
 *
 * Every buffer owns *two* render targets, not one. A buffer that samples its own
 * previous frame — a trail, a fluid, a reaction-diffusion — is reading and
 * writing the same logical image in the same draw call, which no GPU allows. So
 * it reads one target and writes the other, and they trade places at the end of
 * the frame: the classic ping-pong. `front` is always the frame just finished
 * and `back` is always the one being drawn into.
 *
 * The other half of the job is the bookkeeping that a pair of GPU allocations per
 * pass makes unavoidable. Targets are created when a buffer appears, resized only
 * when their size genuinely changes (a resize reallocates the texture and throws
 * its contents away — for a feedback buffer that is the loss of its entire
 * history, so doing it on every `ResizeObserver` tick would be catastrophic),
 * and disposed when the buffer is deleted or the engine is.
 *
 * Everything allocated here is tagged with the owning `GlContext`, exactly as the
 * rest of the renderer's GPU resources are: a target from another context would
 * be silently re-uploaded by three and then freed out from under whoever else
 * held it.
