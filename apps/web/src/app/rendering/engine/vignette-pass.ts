/**
 * A resolution-independent vignette: every quantity in the fragment shader is
 * derived from `vUv`, so the effect needs no resolution uniform and there is
 * nothing for `PostProcessing.setSize` to feed it on a resize — unlike Bloom,
 * whose kernel is sized in real pixels.
 *
 * `roundness` blends the darkened shape between one that hugs the screen's
 * own rectangle (0) and a perfect circle (1); `softness` controls how sharp
 * the transition from clear to vignetted is; `intensity` blends the whole
 * effect between untouched (0) and fully applied (1). Alpha passes through
 * unchanged — this runs after the final Image pass, and the composer's own
 * output must stay whatever alpha that pass produced.
