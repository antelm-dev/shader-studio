/**
 * What `iChannel0…3` are pointing at, right now.
 *
 * A binding is a *description* — "slot 2", "buffer B's previous frame" — and the
 * two halves of turning one into a `THREE.Texture` are owned elsewhere and stay
 * there: image slots by `TextureManager`, buffer targets by `BufferTargets`.
 * This is only the join between them, which has to exist somewhere because a
 * binding can name either and neither owner is allowed to know about the other.
 *
 * The reason this is done immediately before a pass is drawn, every frame,
 * rather than once at compile time, is that there is no stable answer: a buffer
 * binding names a texture that ping-pongs, so the object behind it changes every
 * frame, and a feedback binding deliberately names the *other* one. Baking the
 * result into a uniform at compile time would freeze a pass on whichever half of
 * the pair happened to be in front when it was built.
 *
 * Nothing is allocated or freed here.
