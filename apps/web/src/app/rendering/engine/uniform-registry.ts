/**
 * The one place a uniform is written across more than one pass.
 *
 * A control is a property of the *project*, not of a pass: turning a knob has to
 * reach every buffer that declares it, or a parameter the whole pipeline is
 * built around would only affect its last step. The same is true of the uniforms
 * the engine supplies rather than the author — `iTime` has to tick inside a
 * buffer exactly as it does in the Image pass, or a feedback simulation and the
 * picture of it drift apart.
 *
 * So the maps are collected here and written through here. What this type
 * deliberately does *not* know is what a pass is: it holds
 * `Record<string, THREE.IUniform>` and an id to file it under, and nothing about
 * materials, scenes, compilation or the order things are drawn in. That is what
 * lets the interaction layer push a pointer or a parameter at the whole pipeline
 * without going through — or knowing about — the compiler or the engine.
 *
 * **The primary map** is the Image pass's, and it is what the single-value
 * questions are answered from: the resolution the canvas is at, the momentum a
 * shader asked for, the texture `iChannel2` currently samples. It is set only
 * when an image program is *accepted*, so it survives a context loss that has
 * emptied the registration list — which is why writing a built-in also reaches
 * it even when it is no longer registered.
